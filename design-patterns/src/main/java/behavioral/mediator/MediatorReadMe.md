## Scenario

### Problem

Have you ever wondered what would happen if three planes landed or took off at the same time? The pilots wouldn’t coordinate directly with each other. To manage this, they rely on air traffic controllers, who work from a tower near the runway. Pilots approaching or leaving the airport don’t communicate directly; they talk to the controller, who helps them know when and where to land. The air traffic controller acts as a mediator, ensuring pilots have a single point of contact for managing air traffic safely.

As simple a coding example, we need to have communication between login button and other parts of the form to perform login action without directly accessing them. 

### Solution

Mediator Design Pattern, like an air traffic controller, defines an object that manages how other objects interact. It is a behavioral design pattern that limits direct communication between objects, promoting collaboration through a mediator to reduce dependencies.
