## Outline

### Problem

In this example, we focus on manufacturing GPUs, specifically for brands MSI and ASUS. We can create MsiGpu and AsusGpu classes representing these brands, which implement a common interface called Gpu. The main class, which contains the business logic, represents the company, while MsiManufacturer and AsusManufacturer classes are the concrete creators that implement the factory method createGpu. These classes produce the respective branded GPUs.

As the company expands to manufacture monitors alongside GPUs, both brands would also create MsiMonitor and AsusMonitor classes. We would rename the Gpu interface to Component, allowing all products to implement this broader interface. Additionally, we would change the factory method in the main company class to createComponents, which would accept the desired product type.

Although these modifications help in managing new requirements, they could lead to needing code changes if new components are introduced, violating the open-closed principle. This highlights that for this scenario, a single factory might not be sufficient, as expanding the product line can complicate the design.

### Solution

Start thinking about moving from the factory method pattern to the abstract factory design pattern. The abstract factory pattern suggests clearly defining interfaces for each product and ensuring all product variants follow these interfaces. Next, create inside the abstract factory your Company class list of factory methods for each abstract product. In this case, we have two abstract products, the GPU and the Monitor interfaces, leading to two factory methods. Each concrete factory will return a specific product or interface, allowing users to interact with any concrete factory through its abstract interfaces.
