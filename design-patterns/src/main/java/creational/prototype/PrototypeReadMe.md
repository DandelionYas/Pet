## Scenario

### Problem

To create an exact copy of an object, first, we make a new object of the same class using the new keyword. Then, we copy the values from all the fields of the original object to the new one. This is straightforward. However, if some fields are private, we cannot copy them easily. Additionally, our copying process relies heavily on knowing the class. In cases with third-party applications, we may only have access to the object itself, not its class, making duplication challenging.

### Solution

If you face such situations while developing an application, the solution is the Prototype Design Pattern. This pattern allows for cloning objects without tying the object creation to its specific class. To use this pattern, start by creating a common interface for all cloneable objects, typically containing a single clone method. This method makes a new object based on the current class and copies the old object's field values into it. This approach not only separates application logic from the class but also provides access to private fields. Users can now create copies of any object that uses the clone method, known as a Prototype.
